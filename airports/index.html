<p>Pune Airport (IATA: PNQ, ICAO: VAPO) is located approximately 10 km (6.2 mi) north-east of Pune in the state of Maharashtra, India. The airport is a civil enclave operated by the Airports Authority of India at the eastern side of Lohegaon Air Force Station of the Indian Air Force.
        
<br/>A â‚¹1 billion airport modernisation plan was launched in August 2008 ahead of the Commonwealth Youth Games hosted by Pune. AAI constructed two new terminal buildings for international passenger departures and arrivals, measuring nearly 12,000 sq. mt. on either side of the 6,500 sq mt old main terminal building which was inadequate for the increase in passengers and flight operations. The new buildings have helped ease peak-time pressure of air passengers. Facilities developed on the air side include a new parallel taxi track and an apron expanded to accommodate eight Airbus A320 or Boeing 737 aircraft. Two aerobridges were also commissioned in 2011. New conveyor belts and passenger facilities including a modern spa were also commissioned.</p>
